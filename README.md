This is the README file for the MooTyper project. MooTyper is
a moodle extension, that adds the 'typing instructor' functionallity to Moodle. 
The plugin url is: https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_mootyper

MooTyper is free software, the same as Moodle.

1. REQUIREMENTS

The MooTyper module uses javascript which is not welcome in Moodle but it is a
requirement for the use of the module. The typing procedure cannot be done without
the client side logic.

It creates some new tables in a moodle database and inserts some sample
typing exercises. This is all done automaticaly through the intstallation,
but real lessons and exercises should be added by teachers afterwards.

2. INSTALLATION

MooTyper is an activity module. You have to extract it to the 'mod' directory.
If the directory name is something like "moodle_mod_mootyper" you have to change
that to just "mootyper". So for example, the path should be like this:
<your moodle installation>/mod/mootyper/view.php

Than go to Site Administration -> Notifications and click on the button to start
the install.

Right after an install or upgrade of the new MooTyper 3.1.1, you will then see
the settings page. You can now set the date display format for the grade views.
You can also set colors for grade views, the background of the new keyboard 
layouts, and the color for keytops that are not home row keys. This allows you
to color coordinate MooTyper with your theme color scheme. 

3. USING MOOTYPER

Using MooTyper activity module is very simple. An instance can be added as a
new activity in a course like Lesson or Quiz. Thanks to Mary Cooch from moodle.org
we have this video, which shows how to add exercises, create mootyper instance,
and then view grades. It's a little outdated (one of the first versions of
mootyper), but I guess everything still holds:

4. ADDITIONAL KEYBOARD LAYOUTS

This MooTyper currently includes support for new versions (V21) of English, Japanese,
Russian Slovenian, Spanish and Swiss keyboard layouts, that are compatible with both
the new Boost theme as well as Clean.

To implement any other layout you have to:
Create a php file with keyboard layout defined with HTML. Create a javascript
file (with the same name and .js extension) that implements the logic of the keyboard
layout. If you have any mistakes in your js file the module won't work, so in
this case try to validate your code with a tool like this...

5. SAVING YOUR OWN OR MODIFIED LESSONS

In previous versions of MooTyper, if you created your own lessons there was
no built in way to export a copy for backup purposes or for safekeeping.
Once installed, there was no way to add additional lessons to MooTyper
unless you used the built in editing capability, which is not as convienient
as it would be to create lessons in a word processing program. If you wanted
to add lessons to MooTyper without using the built in editor, you had to do
a completely new installation of MooTyper which meant you would lose all
student progress and grades.
As of version 3.1.0, MooTyper now supports Import and Export of MooTyper Lessons
via links in the Administration block, which overcomes these limitations.

6. NEW IN THIS RELEASE

There are now three typing modes. 
  1.The original mode -This mode requires you to type the correct letter before
  you can move to the next letter. Extra spaces are ignored. Mistyped letters
  are counted as mistakes.
  2. Count mistyped spaces - Same as the original mode, but counts mistyped spaces
  as well as mistyped letters.
  3. Continuous typing - In this mode you do not have to type the correct letter
  before moving to the next letter. All mistyped letters and space are counted
  as mistakes.

If a user clicks 'Views my grades' they will now see a horizontal bar chart beneath
their grade table that charts Hits per minute, Presision, and WPM results.
If a non-editing teacher, teacher, manager, or admin, clicks on 'View all grades'
they will see the normal grade table as well as horizontal bar charts showing
Hits per minute, Prescison, and WPM for each exercise for each student.
